I'm Andy. I live in Austin, Texas and I'm a mathematician, cyclist, cat dad, and wannabe AI researcher. This site is primarily for posting my thoughts and progress in my capacity as the final of those roles.

# Cycling
I've done several long distance bikepacking trips. I did [RAGBRAI](https://ragbrai.com/) in 2021 and 2022. Before that, I did a 10 week, cross country ride in 2018.

# Math
I finished a doctorate in mathematics from the University of Michigan in 2024. My advisor was [Charlotte Chan](https://websites.umich.edu/~charchan/). My thesis was in the intersection of algebraic geometry, number theory, and representation theory. My old academic website is [here](https://public.websites.umich.edu/~ndygordn/index.html).
